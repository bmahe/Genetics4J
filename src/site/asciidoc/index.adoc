== Introduction

Genetics4j is an open source library for Evolutionary Algorithms. This includes Genetic Algorithm, Genetic Programming and more!

=== Features

* Genetic Algorithms
* Strongly Typed Genetic Programming
* Multi-Objective Optimization support with algorithms such as NSGA2 and SPEA2
* NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies, also known as NEAT
* Supports multiple replacement strategies
* Configurable and user friendly
* Multi-GPU and Multithreaded based implementations for faster execution
* Clear separation between the problem definition and its execution model
* Enhanced test coverage with link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing[mutation testing] :)


The project is located at https://gitlab.com/bmahe/genetics4j and is licensed under the Apache License v2.0.


=== Modules

Genetics4j encompass multiple aspects of the Evolutionary Algorithms family through different modules:

* _core_: Contains the core features for *Genetic Algorithms*
* _gp_: Contains features related to *Genetic Programming*
* _moo_: Contains features related to *Multi-Objective Optimization*
* _neat_: Contains features related to _NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies_, also known as *NEAT*
* _gpu_: Multi-GPU and hardware accelerator support
* _samples_: Contains different examples to highlight the different features and how to use them
* _extras_: Extra set of classes which can be useful but do not necessarily fit in other modules. Example: There is a CSV Evolution listener to record population over time along with any extra configurable attributes


== Documentation

There are various ways to learn more about _Genetics4j_:

* There is a link:docs/quickstart.html[Quick Start] guide to help you get up and running in minutes!
* Each module contains its own documentation
* Javadocs are built for the link:apidocs/index.html[whole project] as well as for each individual modules. They can be found under _Project Reports_
* Various additional reports are also published under _Project Reports_, including link:gitlog.html[changelogs] and tests results and coverage


# Examples

There are a few examples with this library. Namely:

* link:https://genetics4j.org/samples/docs/clustering.html[Clustering] where we attempt to find the best way to cluster data and compare the different approaches
* link:https://genetics4j.org/samples/docs/mixture_models_on_gpu.html[Mixture Models] where we attempt to find the best way to cluster data using mixture models with the help of GPUs
* link:https://genetics4j.org/samples/docs/bloat_issues.html[6 ways to handle your bloat issues] where we explore different methods from the _Multi Objective Optimization_ field to find the best equation to represent a set of data points. This provides us a way to find a good trade-off between long and precise equations and shorter but less precise equations
* link:https://genetics4j.org/samples/docs/fitness_sharing.html[Fitness Sharing] where we present one technique to reduce the likelihood to get stuck in a local optimum and explore a great set of diverse solutions
* link:https://genetics4j.org/samples/docs/neat_xor.html[Impelementing XOR with NEAT] where we implement a XOR gate with NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (_NEAT_)
* link:https://genetics4j.org/samples/docs/evolutionary_painting.html[Evolutionary Painting with GPUs] where we use genetic algorithms to generate whole paintings. We also use GPUs for faster computations
