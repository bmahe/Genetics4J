== Introduction

Genetics4j is an open source library for Evolutionary Algorithms. This includes Genetic Algorithm, Genetic Programming and more!

=== Features

* Genetic Algorithms
* Strongly Typed Genetic Programming
* Multi-Objective Optimization support with algorithms such as NSGA2
* Supports multiple replacement strategies
* Configurable and user friendly
* Multithreaded implementation for faster execution
* Clear separation between the problem definition and its execution model
* Enhanced test coverage with link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing[mutation testing] :)
