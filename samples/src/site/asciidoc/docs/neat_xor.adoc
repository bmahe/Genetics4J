== Preface

All the executions and plots are generated from scratch at build time. This means results may vary from execution to execution.

This also creates some constraints in terms of execution time. A proper analysis would have us execute each approach many times prior to making any generalization, which we cannot afford here.

While I could use the same seed for the random generator and therefore generate reproducible results, this wouldn't be befitting of a demonstration of evolutionary algorithms.

Note also the purpose of this document is to serve me as notes and is not meant to be taken as exhaustive or a fully fledged blog post.



== Introduction

Implementing a *XOR* gate with NEAT is a typical demonstration as it is not only used in the original paper 
link:https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?stanley:ec02[Evolving Neural Networks Through Augmenting Topologies] but also a problem
that does require the use of an additional node in the network.

Therefore it is an ideal use case to explore.


== Methodology

=== Chromosomes

We want to implement a *XOR* gate, and as such will need 2 input nodes and 1 output node. We will also add a bias node that will always be set to 1.
The networks will be fully connected upon initialization and look something like:

[graphviz,  "neat-xor", format=svg]
....
digraph g {
	rankdir=LR;

	A -> xor
	B -> xor
	bias -> xor

	xor[label="A xor B"]
}
....

The connections will be enabled and their weight randomly selected.

The network used will be a feed forward network (ie. no loops), and will use _tanh_ as its activation function.

This translates in code to:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/net/bmahe/genetics4j/samples/neat/Main.java[tags=network_definition]
----

Where _connections_ is the list of connections defining the network


=== Fitness

The fitness will be computed by evaluating each of the possible inputs and comparing them with the expected output of a
XOR gate. The closer to the expectations, the higher will the score be.

Since we want a more fine grained fitness for better comparing individuals, we will use the distance to the expectations
as an error measurement and deduct it from the ideal score. Thus scores can go from 0 to 4, where 4 means a perfect score.

The code to implement the fitness is:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/net/bmahe/genetics4j/samples/neat/Main.java[tags=fitness_definition]
----

=== Configuration

To specify the problem, we can use a standard _EAConfiguration_ with the following tweaks:

* We define the chromosome of type _NeatChromosome_ with 3 inputs and one output
* We have a specific selection for the parents
* We have a specific set of operators for the mutations
* We have a specific _NeatCombination_ that implements the combination of two parents as specified in the _NEAT_ paper
* We assume a fitness equal or greater to 3.95 is good enough to our goal


The configuration is defined as:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/net/bmahe/genetics4j/samples/neat/Main.java[tags=eaConfiguration]
----



With regards to the selection policy, while there exist a factory with sensible defaults
(see link:../../neat/apidocs/net/bmahe/genetics4j/neat/spec/selection/NeatSelection.html#ofDefault()[NeatSelection::ofDefault] ), we do want to ensure the following:

* We only keep the top 20% of the individuals for each species
* We will always keep at least 1 individual for a species
* Selecting individuals within a species is done through tournaments

Thus the code will be: 

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/net/bmahe/genetics4j/samples/neat/Main.java[tags=neatSelection]
----


In terms of mutations, we can find the two main types of mutations being separated:

* The mutations that affect weights, such as creep, neat or random changes.
* The mutations that affect the structure

It is to be noted how high are set the mutations:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/net/bmahe/genetics4j/samples/neat/Main.java[tags=neatMutations]
----


And then we need the execution context, which will be very simple as we only want to specify the population and some
evolution listeners so we can log and record how the algorithm performs:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/net/bmahe/genetics4j/samples/neat/Main.java[tags=eaExecutionContext]
----


Finally, we can launch the computations:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/net/bmahe/genetics4j/samples/neat/Main.java[tags=evolve]
----

== Results


The results are pretty nice and it will consistently find a solution very quickly. The networks are small and do tend 
to exhibit similar patterns.

It is interesting to note that the bias node has consistently its connections disabled or outright removed.


Here is an example of solution:

graphviz::{outdir}/neat/xor.dot[svg]

Note: remember that all the results in this article are re-computed at each build.


We can also look at the evolution of the fitness over time:

image::neat/fitness.png[Fitness plot]


It is also interesting to look at the nodes:

image::neat/num_nodes.png[Number of nodes]

And the connections:

image::neat/num_connections.png[Number of connections]

image::neat/num_connections_enabled.png[Number of enabled connections]

image::neat/num_connections_disabled.png[Number of disabled connections]


We can observe that while the solutions are consistently small, there is a steady increase in nodes and connections over time.


== Conclusion


_NEAT_ is a very powerful algorithm that can derive great results very quickly. However its parameters are very
sensitive and could lead to a different outcome if not tweak appropriately.

There are also a few topics I would like to dive deeper into in the future:

* Visualizing the species over time. It would be nice to see how they evolve over time
* Digging into the relationship between number of nodes and connection with their fitness
* Digging into the sensibitility to parameters
* Changing starting conditions and not using a fully connected network
* Automatically adjust the compatibility threshold as discussed in the link:https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html[NEAT FAQ]
